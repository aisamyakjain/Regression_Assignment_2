    "\n",
    "Answer:  R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is calculated as the ratio of the explained sum of squares to the total sum of squares, and it represents the goodness-of-fit of the model, indicating how well the independent variables account for the variation in the dependent variable."

    "\n",
    "Answer: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) are commonly used metrics in regression analysis to measure the performance of predictive models. RMSE and MSE calculate the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, while MAE calculates the average absolute difference. RMSE and MSE emphasize larger errors, while MAE treats all errors equally. Lower values indicate better model performance."

However, RMSE and MSE are more sensitive to outliers, while MAE is less sensitive. RMSE and MSE are also influenced by the scale of the data, unlike MAE."

    "\n",
    "Answer: Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, adds a penalty term to the loss function in regression models. It encourages sparse solutions by promoting some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection. It differs from Ridge regularization (L2 regularization) by producing a more compact model. Lasso is suitable when feature selection is desired and when there are strong predictors among the variables."

    "\n",
    "Answer: Regularized linear models help prevent overfitting in machine learning by adding a regularization term to the loss function. This term penalizes large coefficient values, effectively reducing model complexity. For example, in ridge regression, the regularization term is the sum of squared coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter. This discourages the model from relying too heavily on any single feature, leading to more generalizable and less overfit models."

    "Answer: Regularized linear models have some limitations. They assume linearity between the dependent and independent variables, which may not always hold true. Additionally, the choice of regularization parameter is crucial, and the models may not perform well if it is not properly tuned. In some cases, more flexible non-linear models may be more appropriate for regression analysis."

    "Answer: The choice between Model A and Model B depends on the specific requirements of the problem. If the focus is on larger errors, Model A with a lower RMSE may be preferred. However, if all errors are considered equally important, Model B with a lower MAE is better. It's important to note that the choice of metric depends on the context and priorities of the problem, and one metric alone may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of model performance. Additionally, both metrics have their limitations, such as sensitivity to outliers in the case of RMSE and insensitivity to error magnitude in the case of MAE."

    "\n",
    "Answer: The choice between Model A and Model B depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goal of the analysis. Ridge regularization (Model A) can handle multicollinearity well and tends to shrink coefficients towards zero. Lasso regularization (Model B) performs feature selection by encouraging some coefficients to be exactly zero, resulting in a more interpretable model. The choice depends on the desired emphasis: if interpretability and feature selection are important, Model B may be preferred. However, it is important to note that Lasso regularization may select only one variable among highly correlated ones, and its performance can be sensitive to the choice of the regularization parameter. Therefore, the trade-offs and limitations of regularization methods should be considered while making a decision."
